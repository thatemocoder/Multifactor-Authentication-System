# üîê Multifactor Authentication System

This project implements a multifactor authentication (MFA) system to enhance security by requiring multiple forms of verification. It combines facial recognition, speech recognition, and one-time password (OTP) verification to authenticate users.

---

### üìö Project Overview

The system operates through a multi-step authentication process:

1. **Login Page**: Users enter their username and password.
2. **Face Recognition**: Upon successful login, the system captures the user's face using a webcam and compares it with stored facial data to verify identity.
3. **Speech Authentication**: Users are prompted to speak a predefined passphrase. The system processes the audio input to confirm the user's identity.
4. **OTP Verification**: A one-time password is sent to the user's registered email or phone number. The user must enter this OTP to complete the authentication process.

This layered approach ensures robust security by combining something the user knows (password), something the user has (OTP), and something the user is (biometric data).
